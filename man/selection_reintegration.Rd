\item{features_of_interest}{genes of interest}

\item{exclude_samples}{default NULL, else vector of sample names to exclude}

\item{selection_markers}{genes of interest to be used for selection}

\item{percent_expressed}{threshold for percentage of cells that have to express all selection_markers}

\description{
Perform selection of cells/clusters/annotation and then reintegrate and reanalyze
}
\note{
SCT + integration workflow: https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/4896
subset + reintegration workflow: https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/1883
RNA assay set --> selection --> DietSeurat to clean up https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/8073
- reanalyze using same workflow you used for the entire dataset as a blank slate
no need to do MT_features as they are already regressed out, no need to redo doublet and ambient RNA removal
