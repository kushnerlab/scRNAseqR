## https://gist.github.com/slavailn/04de875e93b101a717273009be171e6e
### maybe tryout gage after others or in parallel for extra?

# Packages to try
## TopGO: http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/topGO/inst/doc/topGO.pdf
## GOstats: http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GOstats.html
## ClusterProfiler: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html
### https://guangchuangyu.github.io/2016/01/go-analysis-using-clusterprofiler/


# probably start with trying out TopGO, more recommended than GOstats, however ClusterProfiler most popular by #downloads
