1. Kriegstein to trainedRDataChunks
- chunks data 
-- optional: saves data chunks 
-- optional: trains data chunks (likely impossible route, because need consensus gene space before training, and not after) 
2. Kriegstein RData to SingleR RData
- takes chunked data and trains+tests --> saves data 
3. Visualizing heatmaps and save annotations
- takes trained+tested data and visualizes in heatmaps


in development 
1. classify.R
-- IMPOSSIBLE? --> takes trained data, tests it (might be impossible because need common gene space BEFORE training) \

idea (if possible in R): make utility decorater of function in test_memory_error_catch.R
